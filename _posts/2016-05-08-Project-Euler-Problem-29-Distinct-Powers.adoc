= Project Euler Problem 29 : Distinct Powers

:hp-tags: factorization, perfect powers, prime factorizations, distinct powers, euler project problem 29

I have been lately playing with Project Euler, and I hit problem 29. I had no idea how to solve it to start with, but after much thinking, searching, reading, and learning, I made two solutions that are NOT brute force.

=== The Storage Algorithm

To start with, i tried to find a clever solution myself. After few days of trying, i started understanding that i need to simply find the number of bases and powers that are unique, and then remove the duplicates (extra equivalent ones). But how? go google!

Google told me that everybody seem to give up and use the brute force solution. I am despaired. I do NOT like it. 

After couple of nights and continuous thinking and more importantly someone mentioning represeting unmashable values as vectors of parameters, I thought about representing the unique numbers as ordered pairs.
